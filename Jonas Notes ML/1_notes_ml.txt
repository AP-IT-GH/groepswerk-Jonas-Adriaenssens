TEST1
	attempt 1: stopped at 700 000 steps after 1h7 
		out of memory or crash / standby ? (used 8 environments)

	attempt 2: reduced to 6 environments & resume 
		after some time same problem => see foto's
		700 000 steps as well 
	
	attempt 3: reduced to 4 environments & 
		set ML script to 100 000 steps 
		(yaml still higher)
		& resume
		new crash v2 after 700 000 steps

	
	attempt 4: edit reward system (remove for moving & add for shooting + increase reward for hit)
		change ml script to 10 000 steps
		increase to 8 environments 
		
		manually stopped => targets are in wrong layer; there would've been no improvement

	attempt 5: change target layer to correct layer so the machine will see them
			continued training

		stopped manualy (need to continue but first i'll restart)


TEST2: 
	attempt 1: steps 10 000; 8 environments; reward for hit 3f; reward for movement or shoot .001f; punishment -1f; 
			miss is -1f; 
		unity is verdwenen ? (crashed) 
		stopped at step 702 000
		
	BIJ HET TESTEN : het model denkt meer na over de movement en schiet al enkele targets maar nog niet te significant 
			dit ziet er veelbelovend uit na meer training

	attempt 2: 16 environments & resume
			stopped at 702 000 (prob crash cuz ran out of ram) 
			
	
	attempt 3: TODO: remove reward for moving and shooting
				increase hit reward? 

TEST3: 

	attempt 1: 64 env; added 1 raycast with a reward of .5f to get it to aim
			(no fails => memmory leak seems solved; ram stable) 

	attempt 2: stimulate shooting & increase hit reward 
		
	attempt 3: remove reward foor moving and shooting; add punishment for score = 0 
			increase reward for hit



TEST4: 	
	attempt 1: add negative reward for only looking 
			=> stimulate shooting at a target. 
		improve rays => NEW TEST ML RUN NEEDED
		
		64 env; 

		ran until 2.5 mil steps

	attempt 2: edit scores; add more insentive to fire; change to 2 seconds 
		
		ended when c drive was completely full


TEST5: accidently started on oculus -> to delete



TEST6: 
	attempt 1: env 64; added still targets; improved rewards; 
		=> did not learn what expected

---------------------


different approach => stepwise 

1 restricts movements appear and dissapear target in front
 => leer schieten op een doel

2 add movement & still targets at random locations 

3 throw everything in 


TEST7:	
step grootte = 10000 en 2000 geweest


>step 1: no movement & only reappearing/dissapearing target in front of loop

	attempt 1: env 64 
		till 300 000 (not perfect as he keeps shooting mostly)
		"note: maybe i should've added random times to spawn n despawn target"

>step 2: only horizontal movement and multiple targets around appearing and dissapearing

	attempt 1: env 64		
		remove reward for shooting
		add reward moving
		miss reward to -1.5 (absolute value increase by .5)
